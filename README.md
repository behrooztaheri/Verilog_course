## Using Opendigital js and Verilog HDL Extensions

This repository includes Verilog code examples for logic circuits and computer architecture experiments. To work with the code effectively, we recommend using the following extensions in the Visual Studio Code (VS Code) editor:

### 1. Opendigital js

The Opendigital js extension provides a set of tools and features for working with digital design and Verilog HDL in VS Code. It offers syntax highlighting, code formatting, linting, and more. To install the extension, follow these steps:

1. Open VS Code.
2. Go to the Extensions view by clicking on the square icon on the left sidebar or by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+X`.
3. Search for "Opendigital js" in the Extensions Marketplace.
4. Click on the "Install" button.

### 2. Verilog HDL

The Verilog HDL extension enhances the functionality of VS Code for working with Verilog code. It provides features such as syntax highlighting, code snippets, and linting. To install the extension, follow these steps:

1. Open VS Code.
2. Go to the Extensions view by clicking on the square icon on the left sidebar or by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+X`.
3. Search for "Verilog HDL" in the Extensions Marketplace.
4. Click on the "Install" button .

To learn how to use the Verilog HDL extension effectively, you can refer to the following video tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqIhFxf9kFM.
